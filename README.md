VenoBox
=======

Responsive jQuery modal window plugin

Just another responsive jQuery lightbox plugin, suitable for images, inline contents, iFrames, Google Maps, Vimeo and YouTube videos.

The big difference compared to many others plugins like this is that VenoBox calculates the max width of the image displayed and preserves its height if is taller than the window (so in small devices you can scroll down the content, avoiding vertical microscopic resized images).
